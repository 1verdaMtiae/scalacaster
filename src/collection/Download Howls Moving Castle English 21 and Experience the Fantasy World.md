One of the most striking features of Howl's Moving Castle is the castle itself. It is a huge, ramshackle structure that can change its shape and location at Howl's will. It has four different doors that lead to different places: the Wastes, where Howl's mentor Suliman lives; Market Chipping, where Sophie's hat shop is; Kingsbury, where the royal palace is; and Porthaven, where Howl's friend Calcifer lives. The castle is powered by Calcifer, a fire demon who has a contract with Howl.
 
The castle is a reflection of Howl's personality and mood. It can be beautiful and whimsical, or dark and menacing. It can also be seen as a metaphor for Howl's heart, which he has given to Calcifer in exchange for his magic. As Sophie gets to know Howl better, she also learns more about the castle and its secrets. She also tries to help Howl regain his heart and free Calcifer from the contract.
 
Another important theme of Howl's Moving Castle is the war that is raging between two neighboring countries. The war is caused by the disappearance of the prince of one country, who is actually Howl's former apprentice Turnip Head. The war has devastating effects on the people and the environment, as bombs and airships destroy towns and forests. Howl tries to avoid the war as much as possible, but he also uses his magic to protect the innocent and sabotage the enemy.
 
The war also affects Sophie and her family. Her father died in a previous war, and her mother is pressured by the government to spy on Howl. Her sister Lettie works as a pastry chef in a bakery that is frequented by soldiers. Sophie herself becomes a target of the Witch of the Waste, who wants to capture Howl's heart for herself. The Witch of the Waste is also responsible for cursing Sophie with old age.
 
Howl's Moving Castle shows how war can bring out the worst and the best in people. It also shows how love can overcome any obstacle and heal any wound. Sophie and Howl gradually fall in love with each other, despite their differences and difficulties. They also form a family with Calcifer, Markl (Howl's young assistant), and Heen (Suliman's dog). Together, they face the challenges of the war and the curse, and find their true happiness.
