The movie is not a direct continuation of the first film, but rather a standalone story with a different set of characters and locations. However, it does share some elements with the original, such as the use of CGI and animatronics to create the anacondas, the presence of a greedy and ruthless antagonist, and the inclusion of some exotic animals and insects that pose a threat to the humans. The movie also features some references and homages to other films in the genre, such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Predator.
 
The movie received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized its lack of originality, logic, and character development.
